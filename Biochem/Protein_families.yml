# PROTEIN FAMILY FUNCTIONS
# Family : function

Lyases : Breaks down chemical bonds
Phosphatases : Removes phosphate group

Kinases : Adds phosphate group 
MAPK / Mitogen-activated protein kinases: S/T Kinases; Activated by growth factors or mitogens
CDK Cyclin-dependent kinases : S/T kinases; involved in cell cycle processes
JNK / Janus Kinases : Activated by cell stresses or inflammatory-cytokines

Rhodopsins : Light-sensitive photoreceptor proteins
GPCR / G-protein-coupled receptors : Seven-pass membrane receptors; transport signals across membranes
